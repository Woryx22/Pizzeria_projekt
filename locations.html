                You too can treat your customers to the pizzeria's renowned fresh handmade King Benny pizza. You don't
                have to have a professional pizza maker on your team or a special oven in your shop. Italian recipe
                dough, quality ingredients and the unique taste of stone baked pizza will all be there! We are the only
                Czech manufacturer that prepares frozen pizzas by hand using the same process as in the shop. We just
                don't bake them all the way through. The final step is up to you. <br><br>

                We leave nothing to chance. King Benny pizza must taste the same everywhere, every time. That's why the
                pre-baked pizzas are made by real pizzamasters from the owner families. And that they have to rotate! Up
                to 400 pizzas with a diameter of 30 cm are produced under their hands every day. Read on to find out
                what the secret to their delicious taste is. <br><br>
